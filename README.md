# ASEAN Inflation Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Consumer Price Index (CPI) dynamics across ASEAN countries to assess inflation volatility and risk levels using statistical methods and machine learning models.

## Objectives
- Compare inflation patterns across ASEAN countries
- Measure inflation volatility per country
- Classify inflation risk levels to support economic insight and policy discussion

## Methodology
- Data preparation and harmonization
- Time series modeling (SARIMA and machine learning regressors)
- Cross-country comparison using plots and tables
- Volatility calculation and inflation risk classification

## Key Findings
- Inflation dynamics vary significantly across ASEAN countries
- Indonesia shows moderate inflation volatility relative to the region
- Several countries exhibit higher inflation risk, indicating potential regional spillover effects

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Notes
This project is intended as a data-driven analytical portfolio focusing on economic and public policy insights.
